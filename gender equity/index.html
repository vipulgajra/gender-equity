                Two guiding principles are at the core of gender eqity:fairness and has to do with just treatement
                without favoritism or prejudice,while impartiality is defined as treating al parties equally .Equity,in
                its simplest terms,means meeting communities where they are and allocating resources and opportunities
                and needed to create equal outcome for all community member.</p>

        <p class="para"> <span>BENEFITS OF GENDER EQUITY</span><br>
            Gender equity improves opportunities for all and allows people to pursue their dreams despite gender.
            Below are several benefits of gender equity. <br>

            <span> Example 1: Health Care Benefits</span> <br>
            We cannot overemphasize the importance of gender equity in health care because the medical profession
            has favored the male anatomy in research and education. It was not until 1993 that Congress passed a law
            requiring clinical trials to include women and minorities in the study of diseases and treatments. Yet
            to this day, doctors are more likely to dismiss a woman’s physical pain as being mental, emotional or
            even suggest that the patient is a hypochondriac. An article on WebMD revealed that in 2016, Dr.
            Marjorie Jenkins published a national survey of sex and gender in medical education stating that only
            34.5% of medical students “would feel prepared to manage sex and gender difference in health care.” True
            gender equity in health care means all genders are heard and treated well, instead of having their pain
            be dismissed based on their gender identity and anatomy. <br>

            <span>Example 2: Workplace Benefits</span> <br>
            Employers benefit when the contributions of collective minds are respected and received without
            prejudice, discrimination or favoritism. A work environment that welcomes diversity of thought and is
            free from inequities improves life satisfaction for women and men. Gender equity drives creativity,
            innovation and opens the door to endless possibilities. <br>
